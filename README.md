Today, Covid-19 has affected the whole world. We have been fighting this disease for over a year. 
Throughout the time, countries have worked to create their own education system and adapt to the process. 
In this research, we will see how countries continue their education life after Covid-19 started. 
UNESCO explains which governments and the status of schools in this process. 
This will showcase governments' behavior towards the public's need for education and against disease throughout Covid-19. 
In addition, HDX provides us with all the collected data, and collects it in a systematic way.

This is a project from the Ankara Y?ld?r?m Beyazit University Students. More information about this project:
