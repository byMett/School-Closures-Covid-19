Introduction the Project
Today, Covid-19 has affected the whole world. We have been fighting this disease for over a year. Throughout the time, countries have worked to create their own education system and adapt to the process. In this research, we will see how countries continue their education life after Covid-19 started. UNESCO explains which governments and the status of schools in this process. This will showcase governments' behavior towards the public's need for education and against disease throughout Covid-19. In addition, HDX provides us with all the collected data, and collects it in a systematic way.
What Is the Project Detail?
We will watch how states control the education process after the coronavirus epidemic. We will follow and compare how states have intervened in the education process and the functioning of the process since the coronavirus epidemic.

In this project, I will use Google Data Studio and Google Chart. Because it is useful and free, I will be able to use any statistic and graph I want.
One of the main reasons I chose this project was to produce statistics that would help measure how much education systems are lacking around the world with schools closed.

What Can We Say?
School closure has impacted students and their families' lives in profound ways and girls in less developed countries will suffer the most, UNESCO sharply pointed out.
In an article published on March 31, UNESCO estimated that over 111 million of these girls are living in the world's least developed countries where getting an education is already a struggle. 
These are places where extreme poverty, economic vulnerability and gender disparities in education are highest. It added that in Mali, Niger and South Sudan, – three countries with some of the lowest enrollment and completion rates for girls – closures have forced over 4 million girls out of school.
Finally, while this research is being carried out, it is aimed to be a source for monitoring the whole process well, revealing the damages and applying for solutions. I hope our lives will return to normal soon...
